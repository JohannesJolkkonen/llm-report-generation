# Dynamic Report Generator

A web application for generating dynamic reports with a React/TypeScript frontend and a Python FastAPI backend.

## Requirements

You will need API Keys for [OpenAI](https://openai.com/), [Groq](https://groq.com/), [Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/), and [ConvertAPI](https://www.convertapi.com/).


!IMPORTANT!

DocxTemplater, which is the JS-library for generating docx files, is a freemium library. 
The chart-module used in page 5 is only available in the **paid version**, and has been commented out in this project

## Project Structure

- `/frontend`: React/TypeScript frontend
- `/backend`: Python FastAPI backend

## Features

## Getting Started

Both the frontend and backend need to be running for the application to work.

2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Fill in values in `sample.env`, and rename it to `.env`
4. Start the react app: `npm start`
