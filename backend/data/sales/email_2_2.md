Subject: Re: Exploring Data Platform Solutions for Nexus Retail
Dear Johannes,
I wanted to follow up on my previous email with some additional details about our current data infrastructure and specific goals for this project.
Currently, we're using a mix of on-premises databases and cloud storage, with data scattered across various systems:
MySQL databases for transactional data
MongoDB for product catalogs and customer profiles
Amazon S3 for storing large volumes of clickstream and log data
Salesforce for CRM data
Our immediate goals for the new data platform include:
1. Centralizing all data sources into a unified data lake or warehouse
2. Implementing real-time data processing for up-to-date analytics
3. Developing a user-friendly interface for business users to access insights
4. Ensuring scalability to handle our projected growth over the next 3-5 years
We're also interested in discussing data governance and security measures, as well as potential AI/ML applications that could give us a competitive edge in the e-commerce space.
I look forward to exploring these topics in depth during our meeting.

Best regards,
Alex Chen
Chief Data Officer
Nexus Retail
