Sure. Hey Susan, how are you. 
I'm glad you took the time today to have a call. 
Can I ask first of all, what made you interested 
to talk about this stuff? 
I mean, I sent you an email, so I wonder what was it 
about the email and your situation at your company 
that made you think that this is something that you 
want to learn more about?

0:36 - Susan 
Hello, thanks for having me. 
What really caught my eye in your email was the 
mention of using AI to automate report and document 
creation. 
Our company spends a significant amount of time on 
these tasks and we're always looking for ways to 
improve efficiency and reduce manual labor. 
We're particularly interested in how your solutions 
can help us streamline our processes and produce 
high quality documents consistently. 
Could you provide more details on how your AI 
development services work and how they can be 
tailored to our needs?

1:08 - Johannes 
Yeah, totally. 
I will say this is something that I'm only starting 
to explore now, this automatic report creation. 
I mean, in the past I've done work for previous 
enterprise clients, working with a consultancy, 
and those projects have been around customer service 
mainly, supporting various ways to support customer 
service staff. 
But in doing that work, one of the things I've 
stumbled on is the fact that rather than doing these 
question answering systems, a better leverage point 
might be to actually focus on creating reports, 
which are basically just answering multiple 
questions in a sequence in a particular template. 
So that's the general background. 
So on that note I would love to hear if there's 
something specific or if you can tell me a bit more 
about types of documents and reports that you create 
at your company and that take a particularly lot of 
time repetitively and that's the key part like 
ideally what we are looking at is some kind of 
templated documents. 
That we can easily then just fill in some values 
that are extracted from whatever data you have 
available. 
Some data that's available either internally or 
in external systems that we can use the language 
model to extract the information from and then 
substituting those into a ready-made document 
template. 
So please, if you can tell me a bit more about 
some specific reports, that you can think of where 
this might be applicable or might be able to save 
you time.

2:50 - Susan 
Thanks for sharing that background. 
It makes a lot of sense. 
At our company, we regularly create several types 
of reports and documents that are quite time 
consuming. 
One of the main ones is our monthly performance 
reports. 
These include a variety of data points from 
different departments, such as sales figures, 
customer service metrics, and operational 
performance indicators. 
Each report follows a specific template, but 
requires a lot of manual data extraction and 
insertion from various internal systems. 
Additionally, we produce quarterly market 
analysis reports for our stakeholders. 
These documents are more narrative driven and 
require integrating data from external sources like 
market trends and competitor analysis. 
The process involves a lot of repetitive data 
gathering and writing. 
Which I believe could be automated to a large 
extent. 
Can you explain how your AI solution could be 
integrated with our existing data sources and 
systems to automate the creation of these 
reports? 
Also, how customizable is your solution in terms 
of adapting to different report formats and 
templates?

3:55 - Johannes 
Yeah, so it's all totally customizable, like you 
can define the template as you would with any, 
you can use Word documents, PowerPoint documents, 
even Excels, or a combination of the two, or all 
those three. 
So you mentioned these two reports that you create. 
I wonder which one would you say is the more, 
takes the most amount of time from your staff? 
How would you describe that?

4:27 - Susan 
Great to hear that the solution is highly 
customizable. 
Between the two, the monthly performance reports 
definitely take the most time. 
Each report requires gathering data from multiple 
sources, ensuring accuracy, and then formatting it 
into the template. 
This involves a lot of manual work and 
cross-referencing, which can be quite time-consuming 
for our staff. 
Automating this process would free up significant 
resources and allow our team to focus on more 
strategic tasks. 
Could you walk me through a high level overview of 
how your solution would automate this report 
creation process? 
Particularly how it would handle data extraction 
and ensure the accuracy of the information.

5:08 - Johannes 
Yeah, definitely. 
In order to talk about that, I would love to talk 
a bit more about that. 
Can you first tell me a bit more about what exactly 
are the types of data that you are using for these 
monthly performance reports? 
Where does the data come from 
And what's the process like of looking up those 
various data from different sources?

5:32 - Susan 
Sure. 
Let me give you a bit more detail. 
For our monthly performance reports, the data 
primarily comes from several internal 

5:49 - Johannes 
You were telling me about what exactly is the type 
of data that you're using for these monthly 
performance reports and what is the process like 
of getting, looking up that data from different 
sources.

6:05 - Susan 
Absolutely. 
Let me recap. 
For our monthly performance reports, the data 
primarily comes from these sources. 
One, sales data. 
This is pulled from our CRM system, which tracks 
sales figures, leads, conversions, and customer 
interactions. 
Two, customer service metrics. 
These are sourced from our customer support 
platform, including data on response times, 
resolution rates, and customer satisfaction 
scores. 
Three, Operational performance indicators. 
This includes data from our internal operational 
databases covering production metrics, supply 
chain performance, and inventory levels. 
Currently, our process involves manually 
accessing these systems, extracting the relevant 
data, and copying it into a central spreadsheet. 
Our team then verifies the accuracy of this data 
before transferring it into our report templates 
and adjusting the formatting as necessary. 
This process is both time-consuming and 
susceptible to errors. 
Can you explain how your AI solution would 
streamline this process by integrating with these 
systems, automating data extraction, verification, 
and report generation?

7:10 - Johannes 
Yeah, for sure. 
That already sounds pretty standard almost, like 
data extraction, mostly as I understand numerical 
data. 
So that would be as simple as just integrating to 
the APIs, ideally, that you have in both your CRM 
and your satisfaction system or platform. 
I guess to really focus on the language model side 
of things, I'm also curious if there's some 
unstructured components or unstructured data that 
you also include in this report, such as some 
freeform qualitative description or measures of 
the previous month, something like that, where it 
would be more about extracting and summarizing 
that information. 
Is that also something that applies to this case?

8:03 - Susan 
Yes, definitely. 
In addition to the numerical data, our reports 
also include several unstructured components. 
For example. 
One, executive summaries. 
These are narrative sections that provide an 
overview of the month's performance, highlighting 
key achievements and areas for improvement. 
Two, market analysis. 
This includes qualitative insights from market 
research and competitor analysis, often drawn from 
various external reports and articles. 
Three, customer feedback. 
Summaries of qualitative feedback from customer 
surveys and support interactions. 
These sections require summarizing and synthesizing 
information from various sources, which is 
currently done manually. 
Automating this process with a language model to 
extract, summarize, and generate these narrative 
sections would be incredibly beneficial. 
How would your AI solution handle these 
unstructured data components, ensuring the 
summaries are accurate and relevant to our 
reports?

9:00 - Johannes 
Yeah, awesome. 
In that case, that definitely rings a bell, and 
especially in the context of customer success 
analytics. 
In the past, I've done a lot of work around 
transcribing and analyzing customer service calls, 
for example, to identify recurring themes, 
quality of how the agents, how the customer 
service staff handles different requests. 
So yeah, combining that with the previously 
mentioned numerical metrics, I think there's a 
real good use case there from the sounds of it. 
So if you don't mind, we could also now talk 
about how I would approach this, what this 
engagement could potentially look like, and I 
have some ideas around that.

9:47 - Susan 
That sounds great. 
I'm very interested to hear about how you would 
approach this and what the engagement might look 
like, 
Please go ahead and share your ideas on how we 
could proceed with implementing this solution.

10:00 - Johannes 
Yeah, so basically I would, the way I see and 
the way I typically approach these kinds of 
shorter projects, I'm thinking there would be like 
three phases or three steps to the project. 
First being just one or two weeks, maybe two 
weeks of let's say prototyping, proof of concept, 
testing some small amount of this data and like 
trying out, just trying out some more narrowly 
scoped version of the solution, creating some 
reports, seeing if the data quality and the output 
quality is good enough, let's say, for a more 
production application. 
So then after that, after that two weeks, I would 
say that then we could move on to more just 
iterating on that initial proof of concept for 
about five weeks, just continuing to improve, 
running, testing the system, generating more 
reports, seeing where are the shortcomings, let's 
say, in this report generation, which are the 
parts that do not do not work so well or that 
needs some refinement to be good enough and then 
we can figure out just iterate figure out how to 
improve those parts and 
Then finally maybe another one or two weeks to 
just wrap it all up make sure that the solution is 
well documented and ready for broad application 
in your organization 
So all in all, starting with two weeks of 
prototyping and proof of concept, then five weeks 
of iterative development, and then finally two 
weeks to wrap it all up. 
And I would say right now I have about 15 of free 
allocation. 
For this project. 
So it would be on average varying week to week, 
but on average, let's say 15 over these, what is 
it? 
Seven or no, nine weeks. 

12:28 - Susan 
Thank you for outlining your approach and 
timeline. 
The phase structure described, starting with a 
proof of concept, followed by iterative 
development, and wrapping up with finalization 
and documentation, sounds very practical and 
thorough. 
Here's a quick summary to make sure I understand 
correctly. 
One, prototyping and proof of concept. 
Two weeks. 
Initial testing with a narrow scope to ensure 
data and output quality. 
Two, iterative development. 
Five weeks. 
Continuous improvement based on testing, 
generating more reports, and refining the 
solution. 
Three, finalization. 
One to two weeks. 
Documenting the solution and preparing it for 
broader application within our organization. 

This structure makes a lot of sense and seems 
like it could effectively address our needs. 
What would be the next steps if we decide to move 
forward with this proposal?

13:29 - Johannes 
Yeah, I can wrap it all up for you in like a 
proper proposal documents and then after that we 
can just start, it's really just a matter of 
While figuring out the scope of actual delivery 
and then setting up our kick-off dates, the first 
things, of course, we'll need to think about is 
getting access to all your systems. 
But yeah, we can take it from there. 
Definitely just starting with the proposal and 
then we can discuss the details there. 
So to summarize also the solution to propose 
here is like it would probably be like a web 
application UI where you can let's say select a 
given month that you want to generate the monthly 
performance report for enter maybe some user 
control over what sections you want to include, 
maybe some user selection over what template to 
use. 
We could even have a few different or a couple 
of different templates for different scenarios 
or different styles or different departments. 
So that would all be done or served through this 
custom standalone web UI or this platform, just 
simple UI where your staff can generate these 
monthly reports. 
And this would be delivered over this eight to 
nine week project.

14:53 - Unidentified Speaker 
Cool.

15:00 - Unidentified Speaker 
That sounds like a solid plan.
