**Subject:** Proposal for Automating Report Creation - Next Steps  

Dear Susan,

Thank you for taking the time to discuss your company's needs and the potential collaboration with Funktio.ai. Based on our conversation, I have outlined a proposal for automating your monthly performance reports and quarterly market analysis reports.

**Solution Overview:**
- A web application UI allowing users to select the month, control report sections, and choose templates.
- Integration with your CRM system, customer support platform, and operational databases.
- Automation of both structured data extraction and unstructured data summarization.

**Estimated Cost:**
- Average of 15 hours per week over 9 weeks.

**Next Steps:**
- I will prepare a detailed proposal document for your review.
- Upon approval, we can discuss access to your systems and set up our kick-off date.

Please let me know if you have any further questions or require additional information. I look forward to our continued collaboration.

Best regards,  
Johannes Jolkkonen
